In this project you will develop a web application using Flask in Docker or using a programming language/platform of the scrum team's choosing. This project will be similar to your project 3a as you will be able to use the same framework to build this application.

Scenario
You and a number of IT students are going to a ski trip/hackathon over winter break in Colorado. To manage sign ups, the program has asked your team to create a simple web based reservation system so that students can reserve their seats on the bus. Students will be charged different amounts based on the seat they pick. You will be provided with a pricing chart for the seating.
